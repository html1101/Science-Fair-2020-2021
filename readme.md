Creating Antibodies Using Genetic Algorithms

Steps(Using Javascript):
- Load 4uif.pdb and the FASTA. That will be the PDB(protein data base) file that we will use, as well as the genetic code(which we'll use later; it helps us identify the chains).
This file describes the Dengue virus and the human antibodies surrounding it.
- Now, within application_viewer, do the following:
  - Load OIMO.js and Three.js. OIMO is a wrapper of Three.js that provides a simple physics simulator.
  - Render the antigen molecules described within the .pdb.
