---------
**Big Dates**

Feb. 7: Scienteer finished

Feb. 13: Slides finished

Feb. 15: Hear from judges

Feb. 20: Presentation


**Todo**
- Find the antigen
  - Given antigen name, isolate it within full genome and run program on it
  - Create lookup table and identify which to use
- Create GA measuring:
  - GC content
  - Codon optimization(looking at frequency of codons in human body & use less rare ones)
  - Hairpin structures
  - CAI Index
- Fix collapsed
